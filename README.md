# BJC sample

This is a repo for some bits of code for a tutorial.

## SQLiteFileBlob

This solution demonstrates how to read a file from disk and save to a
Binary field in SQLite DB and how to retrieve the file from the DB and
save to the disk.

There are two versions of this project. The second version
SQLiteFileBlob2 shows how to take most of the main UI and it's methods
into a User Control in order to keep code neat and separate.

## SearchUI

This project shows how to use a text box to get user text to find in a
list. The search is triggered by pressing Enter in the text box or by
clicking a button.
